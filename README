[protoparse]

 [general]
 a library to parse various protocols to protocol buffers
 current protocols:
 - MRT (BGP4MP)
 - BGP

 The main interface in protoparse is PbVal and the types that implement it
 are structures that usually have a buf []byte buffer that as the messages are
 parsed it is advanced and a a dest protocol buffer pointer that the data is stored.
 The functions of the interface is Parse() (PbVal, error) and String() string
 once an of type PbVal is created with an underlying buffer buf upon calling Parse() on 
 it another object that satisfies the PbVal interface is returned. this we way we can 
 recurse in the container formats while populating the internal protocol buffer messages.

[commands]
 gobgpdump: dumps entries in an MRT update file with BGP4MP entries
 recordfilegen: generated go code to store and retrieve generic records based on the type
                that the user provides as arguments

[usage]
  run make. the gobgpdump binary should be under cmd/. Running it on an MRT file produces 
  bgpdump like output. 
  make test will fetch a sample file from the http://bgpmon.io archive , store it under /tmp
  and run the gobgpdump command on it.
  (for more info on the archive see: http://bgpmon.io/archive/help)

[TODO]
 - more protocols
 - MRT RIB dumps
 - gobgpdump tool support for more outputs (json).
 - gobgpdump tool to dump in len prefixed protobuf files
 - godoc
