  Protoparse is a library to parse various protocols to protocol buffers

# Installation

 Just include the library from your Golang project and use the API.
 Running make will just run tests on this package and all subpackages.

# Current protocols:

 - MRT (BGP4MP)
 - BGP
 - RIB

# Design

 The main interface in protoparse is PbVal and the types that implement it
 are structures that usually have a buf []byte buffer that as the messages are
 parsed it is advanced and a a dest protocol buffer pointer that the data is stored.
 The functions of the interface is Parse() (PbVal, error) and String() string
 once an of type PbVal is created with an underlying buffer buf upon calling Parse() on 
 it another object that satisfies the PbVal interface is returned. this we way we can 
 recurse in the container formats while populating the internal protocol buffer messages.

# TODO

 1. more protocols
 2. godoc
